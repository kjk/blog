If there is one thing that has to be present in a business model it’s scarcity. The one thing common to selling furniture, gold, cookies, CDs, software, licensing patents etc., is the scarcity of the thing you’re selling. Gold is a great example. I can’t think of something less useful, less desirable and not even very pretty, than gold. Yet it’s ridiculously expensive. Gold’s value is artificial, it’s a historical accident (gold was valuable because it was scarce in nature and as such was a great substitute of money when money didn’t yet exist). We, as a society, perpetuate this historical accident. It only works because we all play the game. Now, salt is different but also demonstrates the crucial aspect of scarcity. Today I can get all the salt I’ll ever need to consume in my lifetime for less than $100. You might not know it, but there was a time (a long time ago) when salt was terribly expensive because people didn’t know how to produce it. It was scarce. Or you might have heard that around the time Columbus lived it was worth to make a very expensive expedition to get spices from other continents. The same thing that you’ll get at QFC for a few bucks. Scarcity again."
