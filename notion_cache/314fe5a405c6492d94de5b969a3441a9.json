I guess it makes sense since its first purpose is to detect deleted files and moving files around or defragmenting hard-drives might leave the file system info that Restorer2000 picks up. During recovery you can either tell Restorer2000 to skip duplicate files or rename them. The second option requires more hard-drive space."
