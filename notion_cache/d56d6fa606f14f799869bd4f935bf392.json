You’ll find that many, just like Adam, preach the viability of the support business, but when it comes to pony up the cash for code improvements they need, they won’t. They will just ask you to code the changes for free. If you do, they’ll use your stuff. If you don’t, they will pay Oracle if it already has a solution that solves their problem instead of paying PostgreSQL developers to add this functionality.
