Young men after they get through their business training, or
apprenticeship, instead of pursuing their avocation and rising
in their business, will often lie about doing nothing. They
say, "I have learned my business, but I am not going to be a
hireling; what is the object of learning my trade or
profession, unless I establish myself?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Have you capital to start with?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
"No, but I am going to have it."
</p>

<p align="justify">
"How are you going to get it?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
"I will tell you confidentially; I have a wealthy old aunt, and
she will die pretty soon; but if she does not, I expect to find
some rich old man who will lend me a few thousands to give me a
start. If I only get the money to start with I will do well."
</p>

<p align="justify">
There is no greater mistake than when a young man believes he
will succeed with borrowed money. Why? Because every man's
experience coincides with that of Mr. Astor, who said, "it was
more difficult for him to accumulate his first thousand
dollars, than all the succeeding millions that made up his
colossal fortune."  Money is good for nothing unless you know
the value of it by experience. Give a boy twenty thousand
dollars and put him in business, and the chances are that he
will lose every dollar of it before he is a year older. Like
buying a ticket in the lottery, and drawing a prize, it is
"easy come, easy go." He does not know the value of it; nothing
is worth anything, unless it costs effort.  Without self-denial
and economy, patience and perseverance, and commencing with
capital which you have not earned, you are not sure to succeed
in accumulating. Young men, instead of "waiting for dead men's
shoes," should be up and doing, for there is no class of
persons who are so unaccommodating in regard to dying as these
rich old people, and it is fortunate for the expectant heirs
that it is so. Nine out of ten of the rich men of our country
to-day, started out in life as poor boys, with determined
wills, industry, perseverance, economy and good habits.  They
went on gradually, made their own money and saved it; and this
is the best way to acquire a fortune. Stephen Girard started
life as a poor cabin boy, and died worth nine million dollars.
A. T. Stewart was a poor Irish boy; and he paid taxes on a
million and a half dollars of income, per year. John Jacob
Astor was a poor farmer boy, and died worth twenty millions.
Cornelius Vanderbilt began life rowing a boat from Staten
Island to New York; he presented our government with a
steamship worth a million of dollars, and died worth fifty
millions.  "There is no royal road to learning," says the
proverb, and I may say it is equally true, "there is no royal
road to wealth."  But I think there is a royal road to both.
The road to learning is a royal one; the road that enables the
student to expand his intellect and add every day to his stock
of knowledge, until, in the pleasant process of intellectual
growth, he is able to solve the most profound problems, to
count the stars, to analyze every atom of the globe, and to
measure the firmament--this is a regal highway, and it is the
only road worth traveling.
</p>

<p align="justify">
So in regard to wealth. Go on in confidence, study the rules,
and above all things, study human nature; for "the proper study
of mankind is man," and you will find that while expanding the
intellect and the muscles, your enlarged experience will enable
you every day to accumulate more and more principal, which will
increase itself by interest and otherwise, until you arrive at
a state of independence.  You will find, as a general thing,
that the poor boys get rich and the rich boys get poor. For
instance, a rich man at his decease, leaves a large estate to
his family. His eldest sons, who have helped him earn his
fortune, know by experience the value of money, and they take
their inheritance and add to it.  The separate portions of the
young children are placed at interest, and the little fellows
are patted on the head, and told a dozen times a day, "you are
rich; you will never have to work, you can always have whatever
you wish, for you were born with a golden spoon in your
mouth."  The young heir soon finds out what that means; he has
the finest dresses and playthings; he is crammed with sugar
candies and almost "killed with kindness," and he passes from
school to school, petted and flattered. He becomes arrogant and
self-conceited, abuses his teachers, and carries everything
with a high hand. He knows nothing of the real value of money,
having never earned any; but he knows all about the "golden
spoon" business. At college, he invites his poor
fellow-students to his room, where he "wines and dines" them.
He is cajoled and caressed, and called a glorious good fellow,
because he is so lavish of his money. He gives his game
suppers, drives his fast horses, invites his chums to fetes and
parties, determined to have lots of "good times." He spends the
night in frolics and debauchery, and leads off his companions
with the familiar song, "we won't go home till morning." He
gets them to join him in pulling down signs, taking gates from
their hinges and throwing them into back yards and horse-ponds.
If the police arrest them, he knocks them down, is taken to the
lock-up, and joyfully foots the bills.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Ah! my boys," he cries, "what is the use of being rich, if you
can't enjoy yourself?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
He might more truly say, "if you can't make a fool of yourself;"
but he is "fast," hates slow things, and don't "see it." Young
men loaded down with other people's money are almost sure to
lose all they inherit, and they acquire all sorts of bad habits
which, in the majority of cases, ruin them in health, purse and
character. In this country, one generation follows another, and
the poor of to-day are rich in the next generation, or the
third.  Their experience leads them on, and they become rich, and
they leave vast riches to their young children. These children,
having been reared in luxury, are inexperienced and get poor;
and after long experience another generation comes on and
gathers up riches again in turn. And thus "history repeats
itself," and happy is he who by listening to the experience of
others avoids the rocks and shoals on which so many have been
wrecked.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"In England, the business makes the man." If a man in that
country is a mechanic or working-man, he is not recognized as a
gentleman. On the occasion of my first appearance before Queen
Victoria, the Duke of Wellington asked me what sphere in life
General Tom Thumb's parents were in.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"His father is a carpenter," I replied.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Oh! I had heard he was a gentleman," was the response of His
Grace.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In this Republican country, the man makes the business. No
matter whether he is a blacksmith, a shoemaker, a farmer,
banker or lawyer, so long as his business is legitimate, he may
be a gentleman. So any "legitimate" business is a double
blessing--it helps the man engaged in it, and also helps
others.  The farmer supports his own family, but he also
benefits the merchant or mechanic who needs the products of his
farm.  The tailor not only makes a living by his trade, but he
also benefits the farmer, the clergyman and others who cannot
make their own clothing. But all these classes of men may be
gentlemen.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The great ambition should be to <i> excel</i> all others engaged in
the same occupation.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The college-student who was about graduating, said to an old
lawyer:
</p>

<p align="justify">
"I have not yet decided which profession I will follow. Is your
profession full?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
"The basement is much crowded, but there is plenty of room
<i> up-stairs</i>," was the witty and truthful reply.
</p>

<p align="justify">
No profession, trade, or calling, is overcrowded in the upper
story.  Wherever you find the most honest and intelligent
merchant or banker, or the best lawyer, the best doctor, the
best clergyman, the best shoemaker, carpenter, or anything
else, that man is most sought for, and has always enough to
do.  As a nation Americans are too superficial--they are
striving to get rich quickly, and do not generally do their
business as substantially and thoroughly as they should, but
whoever <i> excels</i> all others in his own line, if his habits are
good and his integrity undoubted, cannot fail to secure
abundant patronage, and the wealth that naturally follows. Let
your motto then always be "Excelsior," for by living up to it
there is no such word as fail.
