Politeness and civility are the best capital ever invested in
business. Large stores, gilt signs, flaming advertisements,
will all prove unavailing if you or your employees treat your
patrons abruptly. The truth is, the more kind and liberal a man
is, the more generous will be the patronage bestowed upon him.
"Like begets like." The man who gives the greatest amount of
goods of a corresponding quality for the least sum (still
reserving for himself a profit) will generally succeed best in
the long run. This brings us to the golden rule, "As ye would
that men should do to you, do ye also to them," and they will
do better by you than if you always treated them as if you
wanted to get the most you could out of them for the least
return. Men who drive sharp bargains with their customers,
acting as if they never expected to see them again, will not be
mistaken.  They will never see them again as customers. People
don't like to pay and get kicked also.

One of the ushers in my Museum once told me he intended to whip
a man who was in the lecture-room as soon as he came out.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"What for?" I inquired.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Because he said I was no gentleman," replied the usher.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Never mind," I replied, "he pays for that, and you will not
convince him you are a gentleman by whipping him. I cannot
afford to lose a customer. If you whip him, he will never visit
the Museum again, and he will induce friends to go with him to
other places of amusement instead of this, and thus you see, I
should be a serious loser."
</p>

<p align="justify">
"But he insulted me," muttered the usher.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Exactly," I replied, "and if he owned the Museum, and you had
paid him for the privilege of visiting it, and he had then
insulted you, there might be some reason in your resenting it,
but in this instance he is the man who pays, while we receive,
and you must, therefore, put up with his bad manners."
</p>

<p align="justify">
My usher laughingly remarked, that this was undoubtedly the
true policy, but he added that he should not object to an
increase of salary if he was expected to be abused in order to
promote my interest.
