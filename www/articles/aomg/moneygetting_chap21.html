It is more precious than diamonds or rubies. The old miser said
to his sons: "Get money; get it honestly, if you can, but get
money."  This advice was not only atrociously wicked, but it
was the very essence of stupidity. It was as much as to say,
"if you find it difficult to obtain money honestly, you can
easily get it dishonestly. Get it in that way." Poor fool!  Not
to know that the most difficult thing in life is to make money
dishonestly! not to know that our prisons are full of men who
attempted to follow this advice; not to understand that no man
can be dishonest, without soon being found out, and that when
his lack of principle is discovered, nearly every avenue to
success is closed against him forever. The public very properly
shun all whose integrity is doubted. No matter how polite and
pleasant and accommodating a man may be, none of us dare to
deal with him if we suspect "false weights and measures."
Strict honesty, not only lies at the foundation of all success
in life (financially), but in every other respect.
Uncompromising integrity of character is invaluable. It secures
to its possessor a peace and joy which cannot be attained
without it--which no amount of money, or houses and lands can
purchase. A man who is known to be strictly honest, may be ever
so poor, but he has the purses of all the community at his
disposal--for all know that if he promises to return what he
borrows, he will never disappoint them. As a mere matter of
selfishness, therefore, if a man had no higher motive for being
honest, all will find that the maxim of Dr. Franklin can never
fail to be true, that "honesty is the best policy."

To get rich, is not always equivalent to being successful.
"There are many rich poor men," while there are many others,
honest and devout men and women, who have never possessed so
much money as some rich persons squander in a week, but who are
nevertheless really richer and happier than any man can ever be
while he is a transgressor of the higher laws of his being.

<p align="justify">
The inordinate love of money, no doubt, may be and is "the root
of all evil," but money itself, when properly used, is not only
a "handy thing to have in the house," but affords the
gratification of blessing our race by enabling its possessor to
enlarge the scope of human happiness and human influence.  The
desire for wealth is nearly universal, and none can say it is
not laudable, provided the possessor of it accepts its
responsibilities, and uses it as a friend to humanity.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The history of money-getting, which is commerce, is a history
of civilization, and wherever trade has flourished most, there,
too, have art and science produced the noblest fruits. In fact,
as a general thing, money-getters are the benefactors of our
race.  To them, in a great measure, are we indebted for our
institutions of learning and of art, our academies, colleges
and churches. It is no argument against the desire for, or the
possession of, wealth, to say that there are sometimes misers
who hoard money only for the sake of hoarding and who have no
higher aspiration than to grasp everything which comes within
their reach. As we have sometimes hypocrites in religion, and
demagogues in politics, so there are occasionally misers among
money-getters.  These, however, are only exceptions to the
general rule. But when, in this country, we find such a
nuisance and stumbling block as a miser, we remember with
gratitude that in America we have no laws of primogeniture, and
that in the due course of nature the time will come when the
hoarded dust will be scattered for the benefit of mankind. To
all men and women, therefore, do I conscientiously say, make
money honestly, and not otherwise, for Shakespeare has truly
said, "He that wants money, means, and content, is without
three good friends."
