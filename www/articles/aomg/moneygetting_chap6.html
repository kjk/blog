Work at it, if necessary, early and late, in season and out of
season, not leaving a stone unturned, and never deferring for a
single hour that which can be done just as well <i> now</i>.  The old
proverb is full of truth and meaning, "Whatever is worth doing
at all, is worth doing well." Many a man acquires a fortune by
doing his business thoroughly, while his neighbor remains poor
for life, because he only half does it. Ambition, energy,
industry, perseverance, are indispensable requisites for
success in business.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Fortune always favors the brave, and never helps a man who does
not help himself. It won't do to spend your time like Mr.
Micawber, in waiting for something to "turn up."  To such men
one of two things usually "turns up:" the poor-house or the
jail; for idleness breeds bad habits, and clothes a man in
rags.  The poor spendthrift vagabond says to a rich man:
</p>

<p align="justify">
"I have discovered there is enough money in the world for all of
us, if it was equally divided; this must be done, and we shall
all be happy together."
</p>

<p align="justify">
"But," was the response, "if everybody was like you, it would
be spent in two months, and what would you do then?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Oh! divide again; keep dividing, of course!"
</p>

<p align="justify">
I was recently reading in a London paper an account of a like
philosophic pauper who was kicked out of a cheap boarding-house
because he could not pay his bill, but he had a roll of papers
sticking out of his coat pocket, which, upon examination,
proved to be his plan for paying off the national debt of
England without the aid of a penny. People have got to do as
Cromwell said: "not only trust in Providence, but keep the
powder dry."  Do your part of the work, or you cannot succeed.
Mahomet, one night, while encamping in the desert, overheard one
of his fatigued followers remark: "I will loose my camel, and
trust it to God!"  "No, no, not so," said the prophet, "tie thy
camel, and trust it to God!" Do all you can for yourselves, and
then trust to Providence, or luck, or whatever you please to
call it, for the rest.
