<p align="justify">
Of course men should be charitable, because it is a duty and a
pleasure. But even as a matter of policy, if you possess no
higher incentive, you will find that the liberal man will
command patronage, while the sordid, uncharitable miser will be
avoided.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Solomon says: "There is that scattereth and yet increaseth; and
there is that withholdeth more than meet, but it tendeth to
poverty." Of course the only true charity is that which is from
the heart.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The best kind of charity is to help those who are willing to
help themselves. Promiscuous almsgiving, without inquiring into
the worthiness of the applicant, is bad in every sense. But to
search out and quietly assist those who are struggling for
themselves, is the kind that "scattereth and yet increaseth."
But don't fall into the idea that some persons practice, of
giving a prayer instead of a potato, and a benediction instead
of bread, to the hungry. It is easier to make Christians with
full stomachs than empty.
