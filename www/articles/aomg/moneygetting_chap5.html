<center><h3>Persevere</h3></center>

<div class="bodycopy">

<p align="justify">
When a man is in the right path, he must persevere. I speak of
this because there are some persons who are "born tired;"
naturally lazy and possessing no self-reliance and no
perseverance.  But they can cultivate these qualities, as Davy
Crockett said:
</p>

<blockquote>
 "This thing remember, when I am dead,<br>
 Be sure you are right, then go ahead."<br>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify">
It is this go-aheaditiveness, this determination not to let the
"horrors" or the "blues" take possession of you, so as to make
you relax your energies in the struggle for independence, which
you must cultivate.
</p>

<p align="justify">
How many have almost reached the goal of their ambition, but,
losing faith in themselves, have relaxed their energies, and
the golden prize has been lost forever.
</p>

<p align="justify">
It is, no doubt, often true, as Shakespeare says:
</p>

<blockquote>
 "There is a tide in the affairs of men,<br>
 Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune."<br>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify">
If you hesitate, some bolder hand will stretch out before you
and get the prize. Remember the proverb of Solomon: "He
becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand; but the hand of
the diligent maketh rich."
</p>

<p align="justify">
Perseverance is sometimes but another word for self-reliance.
Many persons naturally look on the dark side of life, and
borrow trouble. They are born so. Then they ask for advice, and
they will be governed by one wind and blown by another, and
cannot rely upon themselves. Until you can get so that you can
rely upon yourself, you need not expect to succeed. I have
known men, personally, who have met with pecuniary reverses,
and absolutely committed suicide, because they thought they
could never overcome their misfortune. But I have known others
who have met more serious financial difficulties, and have
bridged them over by simple perseverance, aided by a firm
belief that they were doing justly, and that Providence would
"overcome evil with good." You will see this illustrated in any
sphere of life.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Take two generals; both understand military tactics, both
educated at West Point, if you please, both equally gifted; yet
one, having this principle of perseverance, and the other
lacking it, the former will succeed in his profession, while
the latter will fail. One may hear the cry, "the enemy are
coming, and they have got cannon."
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Got cannon?" says the hesitating general.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Yes."
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Then halt every man."
</p>

<p align="justify">
He wants time to reflect; his hesitation is his ruin; the enemy
passes unmolested, or overwhelms him; while on the other hand,
the general of pluck, perseverance and self-reliance, goes into
battle with a will, and, amid the clash of arms, the booming of
cannon, the shrieks of the wounded, and the moans of the dying,
you will see this man persevering, going on, cutting and
slashing his way through with unwavering determination,
inspiring his soldiers to deeds of fortitude, valor, and
triumph.
