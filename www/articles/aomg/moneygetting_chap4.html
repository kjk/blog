<center><h3>Avoid debt</h3></center>

<div class="bodycopy">


<p align="justify">
Young men starting in life should avoid running into debt.
There is scarcely anything that drags a person down like debt.
It is a slavish position to get in, yet we find many a young
man, hardly out of his "teens," running in debt. He meets a
chum and says, "Look at this: I have got trusted for a new suit
of clothes."  He seems to look upon the clothes as so much given
to him; well, it frequently is so, but, if he succeeds in
paying and then gets trusted again, he is adopting a habit
which will keep him in poverty through life. Debt robs a man of
his self-respect, and makes him almost despise himself.
Grunting and groaning and working for what he has eaten up or
worn out, and now when he is called upon to pay up, he has
nothing to show for his money; this is properly termed "working
for a dead horse." I do not speak of merchants buying and
selling on credit, or of those who buy on credit in order to
turn the purchase to a profit.  The old Quaker said to his
farmer son, "John, never get trusted; but if thee gets trusted
for anything, let it be for `manure,' because that will help
thee pay it back again."
</p>

<p align="justify">
Mr. Beecher advised young men to get in debt if they could to a
small amount in the purchase of land, in the country
districts.  "If a young man," he says, "will only get in debt
for some land and then get married, these two things will keep
him straight, or nothing will."  This may be safe to a limited
extent, but getting in debt for what you eat and drink and wear
is to be avoided. Some families have a foolish habit of getting
credit at "the stores," and thus frequently purchase many
things which might have been dispensed with.
</p>

<p align="justify">
It is all very well to say, "I have got trusted for sixty days,
and if I don't have the money the creditor will think nothing
about it." There is no class of people in the world, who have
such good memories as creditors.  When the sixty days run out,
you will have to pay. If you do not pay, you will break your
promise, and probably resort to a falsehood.  You may make some
excuse or get in debt elsewhere to pay it, but that only
involves you the deeper.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A good-looking, lazy young fellow, was the apprentice boy,
Horatio. His employer said, "Horatio, did you ever see a
snail?"  "I--think--I--have," he drawled out. "You must have
met him then, for I am sure you never overtook one," said the
"boss."  Your creditor will meet you or overtake you and say,
"Now, my young friend, you agreed to pay me; you have not done
it, you must give me your note." You give the note on interest
and it commences working against you; "it is a dead horse." The
creditor goes to bed at night and wakes up in the morning
better off than when he retired to bed, because his interest
has increased during the night, but you grow poorer while you
are sleeping, for the interest is accumulating against you.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Money is in some respects like fire; it is a very excellent
servant but a terrible master.  When you have it mastering you;
when interest is constantly piling up against you, it will keep
you down in the worst kind of slavery. But let money work for
you, and you have the most devoted servant in the world. It is
no "eye-servant." There is nothing animate or inanimate that
will work so faithfully as money when placed at interest, well
secured. It works night and day, and in wet or dry weather.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I was born in the blue-law State of Connecticut, where the old
Puritans had laws so rigid that it was said, "they fined a man
for kissing his wife on Sunday."  Yet these rich old Puritans
would have thousands of dollars at interest, and on Saturday
night would be worth a certain amount; on Sunday they would go
to church and perform all the duties of a Christian. On waking
up on Monday morning, they would find themselves considerably
richer than the Saturday night previous, simply because their
money placed at interest had worked faithfully for them all day
Sunday, according to law!
</p>

<p align="justify">
Do not let it work against you; if you do there is no chance
for success in life so far as money is concerned.  John Randolph,
the eccentric Virginian, once exclaimed in Congress, "Mr.
Speaker, I have discovered the philosopher's stone: pay as you
go."  This is, indeed, nearer to the philosopher's stone than
any alchemist has ever yet arrived.
