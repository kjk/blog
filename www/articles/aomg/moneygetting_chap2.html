<center><h3>Don't Mistake Your Vocation</h3></center>

<div class="bodycopy">

<p align="justify">
The safest plan, and the one most sure of success for the young
man starting in life, is to select the vocation which is most
congenial to his tastes. Parents and guardians are often quite
too negligent in regard to this. It is very common for a father
to say, for example: "I have five boys. I will make Billy a
clergyman; John a lawyer; Tom a doctor, and Dick a farmer." He
then goes into town and looks about to see what he will do with
Sammy. He returns home and says "Sammy, I see watch-making is a
nice, genteel business; I think I will make you a goldsmith."
He does this, regardless of Sam's natural inclinations, or
genius.

<p align="justify">
We are all, no doubt, born for a wise purpose.  There is as much
diversity in our brains as in our countenances. Some are born
natural mechanics, while some have great aversion to machinery.
Let a dozen boys of ten years get together, and you will soon
observe two or three are "whittling" out some ingenious device;
working with locks or complicated machinery. When they were but
five years old, their father could find no toy to please them
like a puzzle. They are natural mechanics; but the other eight
or nine boys have different aptitudes. I belong to the latter
class; I never had the slightest love for mechanism; on the
contrary, I have a sort of abhorrence for complicated
machinery. I never had ingenuity enough to whittle a cider tap
so it would not leak. I never could make a pen that I could
write with, or understand the principle of a steam engine. If
a man was to take such a boy as I was, and attempt to make a
watchmaker of him, the boy might, after an apprenticeship of
five or seven years, be able to take apart and put together a
watch; but all through life he would be working up hill and
seizing every excuse for leaving his work and idling away his
time.  Watchmaking is repulsive to him.

<p align="justify">
Unless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by
nature, and best suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot
succeed. I am glad to believe that the majority of persons do
find their right vocation.  Yet we see many who have mistaken
their calling, from the blacksmith up (or down) to the
clergyman.  You will see, for instance, that extraordinary
linguist the "learned blacksmith," who ought to have been a
teacher of languages; and you may have seen lawyers, doctors
and clergymen who were better fitted by nature for the anvil or
the lapstone.
