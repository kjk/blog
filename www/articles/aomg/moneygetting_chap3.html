<center><h3>Select the right location</h3></center>

<div class="bodycopy">

<p align="justify">
After securing the right vocation, you must be careful to
select the proper location.  You may have been cut out for a
hotel keeper, and they say it requires a genius to "know how to
keep a hotel." You might conduct a hotel like clock-work, and
provide satisfactorily for five hundred guests every day; yet,
if you should locate your house in a small village where there
is no railroad communication or public travel, the location
would be your ruin. It is equally important that you do not
commence business where there are already enough to meet all
demands in the same occupation. I remember a case which
illustrates this subject.  When I was in London in 1858, I was
passing down Holborn with an English friend and came to the
"penny shows." They had immense cartoons outside, portraying
the wonderful curiosities to be seen "all for a penny." Being a
little in the "show line" myself, I said "let us go in here."
We soon found ourselves in the presence of the illustrious
showman, and he proved to be the sharpest man in that line I
had ever met. He told us some extraordinary stories in
reference to his bearded ladies, his Albinos, and his
Armadillos, which we could hardly believe, but thought it
"better to believe it than look after the proof." He finally
begged to call our attention to some wax statuary, and showed
us a lot of the dirtiest and filthiest wax figures imaginable.
They looked as if they had not seen water since the Deluge.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"What is there so wonderful about your statuary?" I asked.
</p>

<p align="justify">
"I beg you not to speak so satirically," he replied, "Sir, these
are not Madam Tussaud's wax figures, all covered with gilt and
tinsel and imitation diamonds, and copied from engravings and
photographs. Mine, sir, were taken from life. Whenever you look
upon one of those figures, you may consider that you are
looking upon the living individual."
</p>

<p align="justify">
Glancing casually at them, I saw one labelled "Henry VIII," and
feeling a little curious upon seeing that it looked like Calvin
Edson, the living skeleton, I said:
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Do you call that `Henry the Eighth?'"
</p>

<p align="justify">
He replied, "Certainly, sir; it was taken from life at Hampton
Court, by special order of his majesty, on such a day."
</p>

<p align="justify">
He would have given the hour of the day if I had insisted; I
said, "Everybody knows that `Henry VIII.' was a great stout old
king, and that figure is lean and lank; what do you say to
that?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Why," he replied, "you would be lean and lank yourself, if you
sat there as long as he has."
</p>

<p align="justify">
There was no resisting such arguments. I said to my English
friend, "Let us go out; do not tell him who I am; I show the
white feather; he beats me."
</p>

<p align="justify">
He followed us to the door, and seeing the rabble in the
street, he called out, "ladies and gentlemen, I beg to draw
your attention to the respectable character of my visitors,"
pointing to us as we walked away. I called upon him a couple of
days afterwards; told him who I was, and said:
</p>

<p align="justify">
"My friend, you are an excellent showman, but you have selected
a bad location."
</p>

<p align="justify">
He replied, "This is true, sir; I feel that all my talents are
thrown away; but what can I do?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
"You can go to America," I replied. "You can give full play to
your faculties over there; you will find plenty of elbow-room
in America; I will engage you for two years; after that you
will be able to go on your own account."
</p>

<p align="justify">
He accepted my offer and remained two years in my New York
Museum. He then went to New Orleans and carried on a traveling
show business during the summer. To-day he is worth sixty
thousand dollars, simply because he selected the right vocation
and also secured the proper location. The old proverb says,
"Three removes are as bad as a fire," but when a man is in the
fire, it matters but little how soon or how often he removes.
